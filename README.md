If you use a domain name like sample-xyz.com for TLS configuration in Kubernetes and it is not a registered domain, the TLS setup will work in certain scenarios but not in others. Here’s a detailed breakdown of what to expect:
Internal Use with Unregistered Domains

    Internal Cluster Communication:
        If sample-xyz.com is just for internal use within a development or testing environment and is not meant to be accessible from the internet, you can use it as a domain name for TLS configuration. In this case, the domain does not need to be registered.
        You can access services within your cluster using this domain if your local DNS resolution is set up to recognize it. For example, you might use a local DNS server or modify your /etc/hosts file for testing.

    Local Development:
        In a development environment, you might use unregistered domain names to simulate real-world scenarios. Tools like minikube or kind may allow you to use such domain names locally. Ensure that your local DNS or /etc/hosts file is configured to resolve sample-xyz.com to your local cluster’s IP or load balancer.

Public Access and Registered Domains

    Publicly Accessible Services:
        For services that need to be publicly accessible over the internet, the domain name (sample-xyz.com in this case) must be registered and properly configured with DNS. A registered domain is necessary to ensure that clients can resolve the domain to your server’s IP address.

    SSL/TLS Certificate Validity:
        Public Certificate Authorities (CAs) will only issue certificates for registered domain names. If sample-xyz.com is not registered, you won't be able to obtain a valid SSL/TLS certificate from a CA for this domain.
        For internal or development certificates, you might use self-signed certificates or internal CA certificates, but these will not be trusted by browsers or clients without additional configuration.
