If you use a domain name like `sample-xyz.com` for TLS configuration in Kubernetes and it is not a registered domain, the TLS setup will work in certain scenarios but not in others. Here’s a detailed breakdown of what to expect:

### Internal Use with Unregistered Domains

1. **Internal Cluster Communication**:
   - If `sample-xyz.com` is just for internal use within a development or testing environment and is not meant to be accessible from the internet, you can use it as a domain name for TLS configuration. In this case, the domain does not need to be registered.
   - You can access services within your cluster using this domain if your local DNS resolution is set up to recognize it. For example, you might use a local DNS server or modify your `/etc/hosts` file for testing.

2. **Local Development**:
   - In a development environment, you might use unregistered domain names to simulate real-world scenarios. Tools like `minikube` or `kind` may allow you to use such domain names locally. Ensure that your local DNS or `/etc/hosts` file is configured to resolve `sample-xyz.com` to your local cluster’s IP or load balancer.

### Public Access and Registered Domains

1. **Publicly Accessible Services**:
   - For services that need to be publicly accessible over the internet, the domain name (`sample-xyz.com` in this case) must be registered and properly configured with DNS. A registered domain is necessary to ensure that clients can resolve the domain to your server’s IP address.

2. **SSL/TLS Certificate Validity**:
   - Public Certificate Authorities (CAs) will only issue certificates for registered domain names. If `sample-xyz.com` is not registered, you won't be able to obtain a valid SSL/TLS certificate from a CA for this domain.
   - For internal or development certificates, you might use self-signed certificates or internal CA certificates, but these will not be trusted by browsers or clients without additional configuration.

### Using Self-Signed Certificates

If you are using self-signed certificates for internal or testing purposes:

1. **Generate a Self-Signed Certificate**:
   You can create a self-signed certificate for your unregistered domain using tools like `openssl`:

   ```sh
   openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout server.key -out server.crt -subj "/CN=sample-xyz.com"
   ```

2. **Create a Kubernetes Secret** with the self-signed certificate and key:

   ```sh
   kubectl create secret tls my-tls-secret --cert=server.crt --key=server.key
   ```

3. **Use the Secret in Your Ingress Resource**:

   ```yaml
   apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
   kind: Ingress
   metadata:
     name: my-ingress
   spec:
     tls:
     - hosts:
       - sample-xyz.com
       secretName: my-tls-secret
     rules:
     - host: sample-xyz.com
       http:
         paths:
         - path: /
           pathType: Prefix
           backend:
             service:
               name: my-service
               port:
                 number: 80
   ```

### Summary

- **Unregistered Domains**: Can be used for internal or development purposes, but they won’t work for public access without proper DNS registration and valid certificates.
- **Public Access**: Requires a registered domain and a valid certificate from a CA.
- **Self-Signed Certificates**: Useful for internal testing but not trusted by default for public use.

For development and testing, using unregistered domain names with self-signed certificates can work as long as you configure your environment appropriately. For production, you need registered domains and certificates from a trusted CA.
